      <description>library(ggplot2) library(ggrepel) library(tidyr) library(tidyverse) library(dplyr) Ahmed Elsayes (AKE495)  Data Wrangling and Data Exploration Instructions A knitted R Markdown document (ideally HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 10/11/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., donâ€™t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document).
The text of the document should provide a narrative structure around your code/output.</description>

      <description>Ahmed Elsayes (AKE495) library(readr) LifeExpectancy &amp;lt;- read_csv(&amp;quot;Life Expectancy Data.csv&amp;quot;) names(LifeExpectancy)[4] &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;LE&amp;quot; names(LifeExpectancy)[5] &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;AM&amp;quot; names(LifeExpectancy)[6] &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;ID&amp;quot; Introduction: This dataset shows trends of countries based on their status as either developed or developing. There are 26 variables of 2,938 total observations for this dataset. The reason why there are so many observations is because of the amount of countries and the number of years per country. There are too many variables in this dataset, so the ones that I will be looking at the most are country, status (developed or developing), Life expectancy, adult mortality, and infant deaths.</description>
