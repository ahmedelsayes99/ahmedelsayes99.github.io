<h3>Instructions</h3>
<p>A knitted R Markdown document (ideally HTML) and the raw R Markdown file (as .Rmd) should both be submitted to Canvas by 11:59pm on 10/11/2020. These two documents will be graded jointly, so they must be consistent (i.e., don’t change the R Markdown file without also updating the knitted document).</p>
<p>The text of the document should provide a narrative structure around your code/output. All results presented must have corresponding code. Any answers/results/plots etc. given without the corresponding R code that generated the result will not be considered. Furthermore, all code contained in your final project document must work correctly (knit early, knit often)! Please do not include any extraneous code or code which produces error messages. (Code that produces warnings is acceptable, as long as you understand what the warnings mean!)</p>
</div>
<div id="find-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Find data:</h3>
<p>Find two (!) datasets with one variable in common (e.g., dates, times, states, counties, countries, sports players), both with at least 50 observations (i.e., rows) in each. Please think very carefully about whether it makes sense to combine your datasets! If you find one dataset with 50 patients and it has their age, and you find another dataset with 50 <em>different</em> patients that has their ages, it makes no sense to join them based on age (you would just be pairing up random people of the same age).</p>
<p>When combined, the resulting/final dataset must have <strong>at least 4 different variables (at least 3 numeric) in addition to the common variable</strong> (i.e., five variables total).</p>
<p>You can have as many variables as you would like! If you found two datasets that you like but they don't have enough variables, find a third dataset with the same common variable and join all three.</p>

<p><em>Introduction: I love sports and I love watching the NBA. The NBA is something I find interesting so I decided to do my project on that. In this project, I have chose two datasets. The first shows NBA player height and weight and the second shows points scored per NBA player. I expect to find an association between weight and point as well as height and points because I think being big and tall gives a huge advantage in basketball because of the leverage you would have. The NBA finals just came to a close with and interesting finish so I decided this was a topic I was most currently interested in. However, these datasets are from the 2014-2015 NBA season. I hope to find interesting correlations and learn something new about the NBA through this project.</em></p>

<div id="guidelines" class="section level3">
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If the datasets are not tidy, you will need to reshape them so that every observation has its own row and every variable its own column. If the datasets are both already tidy, you will make them untidy with <code>pivot_wider()/spread()</code> and then tidy them again with <code>pivot_longer/gather()</code> to demonstrate your use of the functions. It's fine to wait until you have your descriptives to use these functions (e.g., you might want to pivot_wider() to rearrange the data to make your descriptive statistics easier to look at); it's fine long as you use them at least once!</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Depending on your datasets, it might be a good idea to do this before joining. For example, if you have a dataset you like with multiple measurements per year, but you want to join by year, you could average over your numeric variables to get means/year, do counts for your categoricals to get a counts/year, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>If your data sets are already tidy, demonstrate the use of <code>pivot_longer()/gather()</code> and <code>pivot_wider()/spread()</code> on all or part of your data at some point in this document (e.g., after you have generated summary statistics in part 3, make a table of them wide instead of long).</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code># data is already tidy

<p><em>The datasets were already tidy so I used the pivot wider function for both datasets and that got them untidy because they were long and that made the datasets wide and so not ever row was assigned to a player and not all cells were filled either. I used the pivot longer function to tidy the datasets back and it worked because each variable has an assigned column, each observation (player) has a row, and there are not empty cells.</em></p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Join your 2+ separate data sources into a single dataset based on a common ID variable! If you can't find a good pair datasets to join, you may split one main dataset into two different datasets with a common ID variable in each, and then join them back together based on that common ID, but this is obviously less than ideal.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will document the type of join that you do (left/right/inner/full), including a discussion of how many observations were in each dataset, which observations in each dataset were dropped (if any) and why you chose this particular join.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>NBA &lt;- inner_join(HeightWeight, stats2, by = &quot;Name&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Error in inner_join(HeightWeight, stats2, by = &quot;Name&quot;): object &#39;HeightWeight&#39; not found</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>glimpse(NBA)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Error in glimpse(NBA): object &#39;NBA&#39; not found</code></pre>
<p><em>I did an inner join which is basically like a merge and what this did is that it cut all the NBA players out that are not on both datasets. This was necessary because then the merged dataset would have NA values if any other join types were used and those players that were not in both datasets would make it hard to find a correlation and make the dataset messy.</em></p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Create summary statistics</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Use <em>all six</em> core <code>dplyr</code> functions (<code>filter, select, arrange, group_by, mutate, summarize</code>) to manipulate and explore your dataset. For mutate, create a new variable that is a function of at least one other variable, preferably using a dplyr vector function (see dplyr cheatsheet). It's totally fine to use the <code>_if</code>, <code>_at</code>, <code>_all</code> versions of mutate/summarize instead (indeed, it is encouraged if you have lots of variables)</p></li>
<li><p>Create summary statistics (<code>mean, sd, var, n, quantile, min, max, n_distinct, cor</code>, etc) for each of your numeric variables both overall and after grouping by one of your categorical variables (either together or one-at-a-time; if you have two categorical variables, try to include at least one statistic based on a grouping of two categorical variables simultaneously). If you do not have any categorical variables, create one using mutate (e.g., with <code>case_when</code> or <code>ifelse</code>) to satisfy the <code>group_by</code> requirements above. Ideally, you will find a way to show these summary statistics in an easy-to-read table (e.g., by reshaping). (You might explore the kable package for making pretty tables!) If you have lots of numeric variables (e.g., 10+), or your categorical variables have too many categories, just pick a few (either numeric variables or categories of a categorical variable) and summarize based on those. It would be a good idea to show a correlation matrix for your numeric variables (you will need it to make one of your plots).</p></li>

<h4>6. Neatness!</h4>
<ul>
<li>Your project should not knit to more than 30 or so pages (probably closer to 10)! You will lose points if you print out your entire dataset(s), have terrible formatting, etc. If you start your project in a fresh .Rmd file, you are advised to paste the set-up code from this document (lines 14-17) at the top of it: this will automatically truncate if you accidentally print out a huge dataset, etc. Imagine this is a polished report you are giving to your PI or boss to summarize your work researching a topic.</li>

<div id="where-do-i-find-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Where do I find data?</h3>
<p>OK, brace yourself!</p>
<p>You can choose ANY datasets you want that meet the above criteria for variables and observations. I'm just sitting here but off the top of my head, if you are into amusement parks, you could look at amusement-park variables, including ticket sales per day etc.; then you could join this by date in weather data. If you are interested in Game of Thrones, you could look at how the frequency of mentions of character names (plus other character variables) and the frequency of baby names in the USA...You could even take your old Biostats data and merge in new data (e.g., based on a Google forms timestamp).</p>
<p>You could engage in some &quot;me-search&quot;: You can <a href="https://support.spotify.com/ca-en/article/data-rights-and-privacy-settings/">request your Spotify data</a> or <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/101917">download Netflix viewing activity</a>, Amazon purchase history, etc. You can use your Google Fit/Fitbit/Apple watch data, etc. These can be combined (e.g., with each other, with other data sources).</p>
<p>You can make it as serious as you want, or not, but keep in mind that you will be incorporating this project into a portfolio webpage for your final in this course, so choose something that really reflects who you are, or something that you feel will advance you in the direction you hope to move career-wise, or something that you think is really neat. On the flip side, regardless of what you pick, you will be performing all the same tasks, so it doesn't end up being that big of a deal.</p>
<p>If you are totally clueless and have no direction at all, log into the server and type</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data(package = .packages(all.available = TRUE))</code></pre>
<p>This will print out a list of <strong>ALL datasets in ALL packages</strong> installed on the server (a ton)! Scroll until your eyes bleed! Actually, do not scroll that much... To start with something more manageable, just run the command on your own computer, or just run <code>data()</code> to bring up the datasets in your current environment. To read more about a dataset, do <code>?packagename::datasetname</code>.</p>
<p>If it is easier for you, and in case you don't have many packages installed, a list of R datasets from a few common packages (also downloadable in CSV format) is given at the following website: (including types/numbers of variables in each)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A good package to download for fun/relevant data is <code>fivethiryeight</code>. Just run <code>install.packages(&quot;fivethirtyeight&quot;), load the packages with</code>library(fivethirtyeight)<code>, run</code>data()`, and then scroll down to view the datasets. Here is an online list of all 127 datasets (with links to the 538 articles). Lots of sports, politics, current events, etc: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fivethirtyeight/vignettes/fivethirtyeight.html</a></p></li>
<li><p>If you have already started to specialize (e.g., ecology, epidemiology) you might look at discipline-specific R packages (vegan, epi, respectively). We will be using some tools from these packages later in the course, but they come with lots of data too, which you can explore according to the directions above</p></li>
<li><p>However, you <em>emphatically DO NOT</em> have to use datasets available via R packages! In fact, I would much prefer it if you found the data from completely separate sources and brought them together (a much more realistic experience in the real world)! You can even reuse data from your SDS328M project, provided it shares a variable in common with other data which allows you to merge the two together (e.g., if you still had the timestamp, you could look up the weather that day: <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/history/" class="uri">https://www.wunderground.com/history/</a>). If you work in a research lab or have access to old data, you could potentially merge it with new data from your lab!</p></li>
<li><p>Here is a curated list of interesting datasets (read-only spreadsheet format): <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit" class="uri">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit</a></p></li>

This is the spurious correlations website, and it is fun, but if you look at the bottom of each plot you will see sources for the data. This is a good place to find very general data (or at least get a sense of where you can scrape data together from)!</p></li>
